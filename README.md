## Why

### Name

The increasingly heated rhetoric across the world has lead to comparisons being made of certain world leaders and the chancellor of Germany during WWII.

Regardless of what you think about such comparisons, the people arguing for the validity of the comparison inevitably justify their disdain for such world leaders through the rational of being able to stop a modern iteration of the aforementioned chancellor before similar destruction is able to take place.

This rational is often punctuated by the question: what would you have done during the holocaust?

In China, citizens who practice Christianity, Falun Gong, and notably Islam, are being systematically persecuted by being forcefully subjected to "reeducation camps".

These camps serve not only serve as "reeducation" centers, but also as forced labor camps; occupants of these camps are farmed of their labor, their hair, and even their organs.

What's more, woman and men who enter the camps are at best put on birth control, and at worst forcefully sterilized.

In my opinion, drawing comparisons between modern leaders and chancellor of Germany during WWII are reductive at best; but if you feel the need to do so, and you find yourself asking the question:

What would you have done during the holocaust?

Rest easy, for the answer is self-evident.

You likely don't have the power to do anything about what the Chinese are doing on your own, I know I don't, but by spreading this information you may get the message out to someone who can.

### Purpose

I built this because when I wanted a banana, all existing CD solutions were offering the entire jungle along with the banana.
